# Automation-of-Playlist-Creation
This model creates automatic playlists based on our previous musical history.

# Introduction
In today's digital era, music streaming platforms like Spotify offer vast libraries of songs, making it challenging for users to manually create and curate personalized playlists. Personalized playlists play a crucial role in enhancing the music listening experience by catering to individual preferences, moods, and musical tastes. To address this challenge, there is a need for automated methods that can efficiently organize large music libraries and generate tailored playlists.

# Objective
The objective of this research is to automate the process of playlist creation on Spotify by leveraging high-dimensional data and CLustering algorithms.

# Methodology:
##### Data collection: Extraction of audio feature data from the Spotify API for songs in a given playlist.
##### Feature selection: Identifying relevant audio features such as popularity, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and valence.
##### Preprocessing: Normalization and scaling of feature data to ensure comparability.
##### K-means clustering: Applying the K-means algorithm to group songs into clusters based on their feature similarities.
##### Playlist generation: Assigning songs to clusters and creating smaller playlists within each cluster.

# Results:
The project has been successfully implemented and tested, and the results are promising. 
The playlists created by the algorithm are highly personalized and reflect the user's music preferences. The algorithm can also adapt to changes in the user's preferences and update the playlists accordingly.![image](https://github.com/MANOJTHECODE/Automation-of-Playlist/assets/92300261/7892d219-c458-4b5c-b073-43b78d5ad773)

## Conclusion:
The "Automation of Spotify Playlist Creation using High Dimensional Data with K-means Clustering Algorithm" project is a significant step towards creating an intelligent music recommendation system that can automate the playlist creation process. The project has shown promising results and can be further improved by incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The code and documentation for this project can be found in this GitHub repository.
